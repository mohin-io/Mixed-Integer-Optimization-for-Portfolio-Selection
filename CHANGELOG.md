## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-04

### Added - Critical Production Improvements ‚ú®

#### Error Handling & Reliability
- **Comprehensive error handling** throughout dashboard application
  - Try-except blocks for all optimization workflows
  - Graceful fallback to equal-weight portfolio on optimization failure
  - User-friendly error messages with `st.error()` notifications
  - Input validation function `validate_inputs()` for all user parameters
  - Validation checks: n_assets > 0, n_days ‚â• 30, max_assets ‚â§ n_assets, etc.

#### Logging System
- **Production-grade logging system** implemented
  - Python `logging` module configured for INFO level
  - Structured log format: timestamp, logger name, level, message
  - Logs all optimization events, errors, and warnings
  - StreamHandler for console output
  - Logs key operations: data generation, optimization steps, validation results

#### Testing Coverage
- **Comprehensive visualization test suite** (`tests/test_visualizations.py`)
  - 50+ unit tests for all visualization functions
  - Tests for gauge charts, efficient frontier, bubble charts, treemaps
  - Monte Carlo simulation tests
  - Drawdown chart tests
  - Rolling statistics chart tests
  - Risk contribution waterfall tests
  - Strategy comparison radar chart tests
  - Edge case handling tests (zero values, single asset, minimal data)
  - Integration tests for complete visualization pipeline

#### Advanced Dashboard Features
- **Risk aversion parameter** exposed in UI
  - User-configurable via sidebar slider (0.5 to 10.0)
  - Default value: 2.5
  - Help tooltip: "Higher values = more conservative portfolio"
  - Integrated into optimization workflow

### Changed

#### Portfolio Optimization
- Enhanced `optimize_portfolio()` with robust error handling
  - Empty DataFrame validation
  - NaN value detection and filling
  - Singular covariance matrix detection with regularization
  - Division by zero protection in Sharpe ratio calculations
  - None-check for optimization results before returning
  - Detailed logging of optimization parameters and results

#### Data Generation
- Improved `generate_synthetic_data()` with error handling
  - Try-except blocks for factor model generation
  - Try-except blocks for DataFrame construction
  - RuntimeError exceptions with descriptive messages
  - Logging of data shape and generation success

#### User Interface
- Enhanced sidebar organization with "Advanced Parameters" section
- Better error messaging throughout application
- Graceful degradation on failures (doesn't crash, shows errors)

### Fixed

- **TypeError in risk-return bubble chart** ([#1](dashboard.py:303))
  - Fixed string concatenation error with list in hover template
  - Changed to use Plotly's `customdata` parameter
  - Hover template now correctly displays weight percentages

- **Text overlapping in efficient frontier chart**
  - Removed inline text label from marker (mode: 'markers+text' ‚Üí 'markers')
  - Added professional annotation with arrow (ax=60, ay=-40)
  - Enhanced visual design: reduced scatter size, added opacity
  - Annotation has white background, red border, proper padding

- **Dependency conflicts for Streamlit Cloud deployment**
  - Resolved alpaca-trade-api vs websockets version conflict
  - Streamlined requirements.txt to essential packages only
  - Commented out conflicting optional dependencies

### Security

- Input validation prevents negative values and division by zero
- Bounds checking on all user inputs (sliders, number inputs)
- Protection against singular matrix inversions
