### 1. **TypeError in Risk-Return Bubble Chart** ✅ FIXED

**Issue:**
```
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "list") to str
Location: dashboard.py:303
```

**Root Cause:**
```python
hovertemplate='...' + [f'{w:.2%}' for w in active_weights.values] + '...'
```

**Solution:**
```python
customdata=active_weights.values,
hovertemplate='...Weight: %{customdata:.2%}<extra></extra>'
```
