## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Sidebar Controls

Access all configuration options in the left sidebar:

#### 1. Data Parameters

**Number of Assets** (5-20)
- Controls how many assets to include in the portfolio
- More assets = more diversification but slower optimization
- **Recommended:** 10 assets for balanced performance

**Number of Days** (250-2000)
- Historical data length for analysis
- More days = more stable statistics but less responsive to recent trends
- **Recommended:** 500-1000 days for reliable estimates

**Random Seed** (1-1000)
- Controls data generation randomness
- Same seed = same data (reproducible results)
- Different seed = different market conditions
- **Tip:** Try multiple seeds to test strategy robustness

#### 2. Strategy Selection

Choose from 4 optimization strategies:

1. **Equal Weight:** Naive 1/N allocation
2. **Max Sharpe:** Maximize risk-adjusted returns
3. **Min Variance:** Minimize portfolio volatility
4. **Concentrated:** Focus on top performers (requires Max Assets parameter)

#### 3. Strategy-Specific Parameters

**Max Assets** (for Concentrated strategy only)
- Limits number of assets in the portfolio
- Range: 3 to number of total assets
- **Recommended:** 5-7 for concentrated portfolios

---

## üéØ Optimization Strategies

### 1. Equal Weight Strategy

**What it does:**
- Allocates equal weight (1/N) to each asset
- Simplest possible strategy
- No optimization required

**When to use:**
- As a benchmark for comparison
- When you want maximum diversification
- When you don't trust optimization models

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Simple and transparent
- ‚úÖ Low turnover
- ‚úÖ Robust to estimation errors

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Ignores asset characteristics
- ‚ùå May include poor performers
- ‚ùå Not risk-optimized

**Example Results:**
```
Expected Return: 6.64%
Volatility: 3.92%
Sharpe Ratio: 1.695
Active Assets: 10
```

---

### 2. Max Sharpe Strategy

**What it does:**
- Maximizes the Sharpe ratio (return per unit of risk)
- Balances return and volatility optimally
- Uses random search optimization (10,000 iterations)

**When to use:**
- When you want the best risk-adjusted returns
- For long-term investment portfolios
- When both return and risk matter

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Optimal risk-adjusted performance
- ‚úÖ Considers both return and volatility
- ‚úÖ Theory-backed approach

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Sensitive to return estimates
- ‚ùå May concentrate in few assets
- ‚ùå Can have high turnover

**Example Results:**
```
Expected Return: 15.20%
Volatility: 4.37%
Sharpe Ratio: 3.482
Active Assets: 10
```

---

### 3. Min Variance Strategy

**What it does:**
- Minimizes portfolio volatility
- Focuses purely on risk reduction
- Ignores expected returns

**When to use:**
- When risk minimization is the primary goal
- For conservative investors
- In uncertain market conditions
- For defensive portfolios

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Lowest possible volatility
- ‚úÖ More stable estimates (uses covariance only)
- ‚úÖ Good for risk-averse investors

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå May sacrifice returns
- ‚ùå Can be too conservative
- ‚ùå Ignores return potential

**Example Results:**
```
Expected Return: 7.44%
Volatility: 3.28%
Sharpe Ratio: 2.266
Active Assets: 10
```

---

### 4. Concentrated Strategy

**What it does:**
- Selects top N assets by Sharpe ratio
- Optimizes weights among selected assets
- Implements cardinality constraint

**When to use:**
- When you want focused exposure
- To reduce transaction costs
- For high-conviction portfolios
- When managing many positions is difficult

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Focused on best performers
- ‚úÖ Lower transaction costs
- ‚úÖ Easier to manage
- ‚úÖ Often higher returns

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Higher concentration risk
- ‚ùå Less diversification
- ‚ùå More volatile

**Example Results:**
```
Expected Return: 18.02%
Volatility: 4.89%
Sharpe Ratio: 3.682
Active Assets: 5
```

## üìà Understanding the Results

### Portfolio Metrics

After optimization, you'll see four key metrics:

#### Expected Annual Return
- Projected yearly return based on historical data
- **Higher is better** (but consider volatility)
- Annualized (multiplied by 252 trading days)
- Example: 15.20% means $100 ‚Üí $115.20 in one year (expected)

#### Annual Volatility
- Standard deviation of returns (risk measure)
- **Lower is better** for risk-averse investors
- Annualized using ‚àö252 scaling
- Example: 4.37% means typical yearly fluctuation

#### Sharpe Ratio
- Return per unit of risk (Return / Volatility)
- **Higher is better**
- Measures risk-adjusted performance
- Rule of thumb:
  - < 1.0: Poor
  - 1.0-2.0: Good
  - 2.0-3.0: Very Good
  - > 3.0: Excellent

#### Number of Assets
- Count of assets with meaningful allocation (>0.01%)
- Shows portfolio concentration
- Fewer assets = more concentrated
- More assets = more diversified

## üìä Visualizations

The dashboard provides 4 interactive visualization tabs:

### Tab 1: Portfolio Weights

**Bar Chart**
- Shows allocation to each asset
- Color-coded for easy reading
- Sorted by weight
- Percentages labeled on bars

**Data Table**
- Exact weight percentages
- Only shows active positions (>0.01%)
- Sorted by weight (descending)

**What to look for:**
- Concentration: Are weights balanced or focused?
- Diversification: How many assets have significant weights?
- Outliers: Any extremely large positions?

---

### Tab 2: Asset Prices

**Line Chart**
- Historical price evolution
- Shows top 5 assets
- Time series view

**What to look for:**
- Trends: Upward, downward, or sideways
- Volatility: How much do prices fluctuate?
- Correlation: Do assets move together?

---

### Tab 3: Correlation Matrix

**Heatmap**
- Shows pairwise correlations
- Color scale: Red (positive) to Blue (negative)
- Values from -1 to +1

**How to read:**
- **+1.0:** Perfect positive correlation (move together)
- **0.0:** No correlation (independent)
- **-1.0:** Perfect negative correlation (move opposite)

**What to look for:**
- Diversification: Lower correlations = better diversification
- Risk concentrations: High correlations = similar risk exposures
- Hedging opportunities: Negative correlations

---

### Tab 4: Portfolio Performance

**Cumulative Return Chart**
- Shows portfolio growth over time
- Compares to Equal Weight benchmark
- Starts at 1.0 (normalized)

**What to look for:**

- Equal Weight: Exact
- Max Sharpe: Approximate (random search with 10,000 iterations)
- Min Variance: Approximate (random search with 10,000 iterations)
- Concentrated: Approximate (random search with 10,000 iterations)

Results are reliable for educational and comparative purposes.

---

### Q: Can I use this for real money?

**A:** This dashboard is designed for **educational and research purposes**. Before using any strategy with real money:
- ‚úÖ Understand the strategy thoroughly
- ‚úÖ Test with real historical data
- ‚úÖ Consider transaction costs
- ‚úÖ Account for taxes
- ‚úÖ Consult a financial advisor
- ‚úÖ Start with small amounts

**Remember:** Past performance does not guarantee future results.

---

### Q: What's the difference between Max Sharpe and Min Variance?

**A:**
- **Max Sharpe:** Maximizes return per unit of risk (balances both)
- **Min Variance:** Only minimizes risk (ignores returns)

Max Sharpe typically has:
- ‚úÖ Higher returns
- ‚ùå Higher volatility
- ‚úÖ Better Sharpe ratio

Min Variance typically has:
- ‚ùå Lower returns
- ‚úÖ Lower volatility
- ‚ùå Lower Sharpe ratio

---

### Q: How often should I rebalance?

**A:** The dashboard shows static allocations. In practice:
- **Conservative:** Quarterly (4x per year)
- **Moderate:** Monthly (12x per year)
- **Aggressive:** Weekly or daily

More frequent rebalancing:
- ‚úÖ Stays closer to target weights
- ‚ùå Higher transaction costs
- ‚ùå More tax events

---

### Q: Can I export the results?

**A:** Currently, results are displayed in the dashboard. To export:
1. Take screenshots of visualizations
2. Copy weights from the data table
3. Note metrics from the summary

Future versions may include CSV/Excel export functionality.

---

### Q: What's a good Sharpe ratio?

**A:** General guidelines:
- **< 0:** Strategy loses money
- **0-1:** Poor risk-adjusted performance
- **1-2:** Good performance
- **2-3:** Very good performance
- **> 3:** Excellent performance (rare!)

Note: These are annualized Sharpe ratios. Adjust expectations for different time horizons.

---

### Q: Why do results change with different seeds?

**A:** Different seeds generate different synthetic market conditions:
- Different asset returns
- Different correlations
- Different volatilities

This helps you:
- ‚úÖ Test strategy robustness
- ‚úÖ Understand sensitivity to market conditions
- ‚úÖ Avoid overfitting to one scenario

---

### Q: What does "Active Assets" mean?

**A:** Number of assets with allocation > 0.01% (1 basis point).

Ignores tiny allocations that are:
- Too small to trade practically
- Result of numerical precision
- Not meaningful for portfolio construction

---
